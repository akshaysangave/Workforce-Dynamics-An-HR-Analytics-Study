# Introduction
The purpose of the Workforce Dynamics: An HR Analytics Study is to analyze extensive employee data to identify key factors affecting workplace dynamics. This study explores trends and patterns in variables such as average attrition rates by department, hourly rates for male research scientists, attrition versus monthly income, average working years per department, job role versus work-life balance, and attrition in relation to time since the last promotion. The aim is to provide valuable insights to support HR policy decisions and enhance workforce management.

# Objective

   - Assess the average hourly wage for male research scientists to identify potential pay disparities and inform compensation strategies.

3. Investigate the Relationship Between Attrition Rate and Monthly Income:
   - Explore how variations in monthly income impact the attrition rate to identify factors that may influence employee retention.

4. Examine Average Working Years for Each Department:
   - Calculate the average number of years employees stay in each department to gauge departmental stability and identify potential areas for improvement.

5. Determine the Correlation Between Job Roles and Work-Life Balance:
   - Analyze the relationship between different job roles and employees’ perceptions of work-life balance to inform role design and support structures.
