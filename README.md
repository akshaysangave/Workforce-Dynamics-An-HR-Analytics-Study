In Workforce Dynamics: An HR Analytics Study, we analyze key HR metrics such as department attrition rates, male research scientists' hourly rates, the correlation between attrition and income, departmental average working years, the impact of job roles on work-life balance, and attrition related to promotion timelines.

### *Tools used - MS Excel, Power BI, Tableau, SQL*

# Introduction
The purpose of the Workforce Dynamics: An HR Analytics Study is to analyze extensive employee data to identify key factors affecting workplace dynamics. This study explores trends and patterns in variables such as average attrition rates by department, hourly rates for male research scientists, attrition versus monthly income, average working years per department, job role versus work-life balance, and attrition in relation to time since the last promotion. The aim is to provide valuable insights to support HR policy decisions and enhance workforce management.

# Objective
**1. Analyze Average Attrition Rate:**
   - Determine the average attrition rate across all departments to understand overall employee turnover trends.

**2. Evaluate Average Hourly Rate for Male Research Scientists:**
   - Assess the average hourly wage for male research scientists to identify potential pay disparities and inform compensation strategies.

**3. Investigate the Relationship Between Attrition Rate and Monthly Income:**
   - Explore how variations in monthly income impact the attrition rate to identify factors that may influence employee retention.

**4. Examine Average Working Years for Each Department:**
   - Calculate the average number of years employees stay in each department to gauge departmental stability and identify potential areas for improvement.

**5. Determine the Correlation Between Job Roles and Work-Life Balance:**
   - Analyze the relationship between different job roles and employees’ perceptions of work-life balance to inform role design and support structures.

**6. Explore the Link Between Attrition Rate and Years Since Last Promotion:**
   - Investigate how the time elapsed since employees’ last promotion correlates with their likelihood of leaving the company to enhance career development strategies.

# Data Cleaning, Data Visualization and Analysis
   - The Workforce Dynamics dataset consists of 50,000 records capturing detailed employee information. These records span multiple departments and roles within the organization, enabling a thorough analysis of factors influencing workforce dynamics.
   - Dataset consists is checked for its integrity for ensuring that we are working on a clean dataset. According to the requirement the chart and graphs for various KPIs are created using Data Analysis Tools. And then built dashboard includes slicers to see results using as per the demand of stakeholders.
   - From the analysis the Insights and Recommendations are found out.
